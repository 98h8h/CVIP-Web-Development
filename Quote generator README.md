  This is the Normal task of the first phase of the August batch offered by the CoderCave as a web development intern.
  In this task, HTML and CSS are used for the whole work and the script is also used for connections with the API.
  In this task, I create a Quote-Box in which every quote will display with their author's name.
  I also create a button for changing the quote
  And also create a connection with the Twitter account for posting that quote
